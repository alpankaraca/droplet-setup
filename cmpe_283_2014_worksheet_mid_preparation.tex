\section*{CMPE 283 How to prepare for the midterm exam}

In response to your  preference for project based assessment, the mid and final exams will be designed to mainly reflect what you have done in your projects so far. 

This will make the assessment ``project based'' while avoiding the common problem that there are some studente who get someone else to do their projects for them. 

The topics in the mid term exam will be every topic covered or practised in worksheets 01-06 \emph{plus} history of the world wide web, construction of web pages using html, the operation of the Domain Name System.

To avoid the exam being a memory test, we will put together a few pages of reference material that will be part of the exam paper given to every student.

We will work together to assemble this material, and it will be published before the exam, then given to you during the exam.

Exam question papers will be individualised, with each student's exam paper being drawn at random from a question bank. So there will be no point in copying from neighbours, as their questions will be different from yours.
